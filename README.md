# Emotion Classification with a fine-tuned BERT & DistilBERT model
Emotion Classification project done as an university assignment.

## Project outline

For this project, I fine-tuned the bert-base-uncased & the distilbert-base-uncased models available on HuggingFace using an emotion classification dataset found on Kaggle and performed inference with PyTorch.
